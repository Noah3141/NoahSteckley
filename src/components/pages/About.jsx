      <h4>Past</h4>
      <p>
        I graduated from University of Montana with a Bachelor's in Psychology,
        and a minor in Russian.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am very interested in clinical psychology, especially efforts to unite
        the field both theoretically and practically. I believe the creation of
        a unified theory may be the key to radically successful progress in
        societal mental health, from couples therapy or treating schizohprenia
        to cultural, economic, and political stability. I have read multiple
        works by Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Carl Rogers, and Erich Neumann, and
        have been working to integrate these models together with the models of
        evolution, neuroscience, and comparative religion, which offers the
        theories found in oral traditions amongst tribal peoples or in religious
        texts, such as the biblical corpus or the Popol Vuh (the so-called
        "Mayan Bible").
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also interested in linguistics, having studied many languages from
        Nahuatl to Mongolian. I am highly proficient in Russian and Spanish, and
        am grammatically and phonologically experienced with German, Polish,
        Swedish, and Mandarin.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was advised to learn to program in order to bolster my applications to
        Clinical Psychology PhD programs. In two months, I learned enough to
        build a full-stack web application that uses natural language processing
        to provide dictionary-form coversion of Russian text. I also gained a
        lot of experience at my work at the time, observing the Google Sheets
        they had, and subsequently have created about a dozen Google Sheets
        which perform various levels of data processing. One of these was used
        to feed a MATLAB script I had written to run statistical analyses on
        datasets I personally collected.
      </p>
      <h4>Present</h4>
      <p>
        I am currently building up this website, in order to aggregate all my
        work into one place, and add a number of articles on psychology and
        physiology, including a number of datasets and experiments of my own
        doing.
      </p>
      <h4>Future</h4>
      <p>
        My hope is to follow the thread of interest where it takes me, which
        currently leads to Clinical Psychology PhD programs, and programming, so
        that I can gain the experience and credentials necessary to make big
        moves for the field... Perhaps with bigger and better web apps :)
