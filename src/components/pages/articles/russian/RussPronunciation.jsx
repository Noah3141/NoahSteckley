                Once upon a taɪm there was a great famine ɪn the land, and
                Monkey could faɪnd no food. There were no bulbs, no beans, no
                ɪnsects, nor anything else to eat. At last Monkey said to
                hɪmself, "Waɪ should aɪ perish here with hunger? Maɪ uncle
                Orang-outang haz enough and to spare; aɪ shall go to hɪm, and he
                wɪll gɪve me food and shelter." So he set out and soon came to
                the place where Orang-outang lɪved. For a long taɪm Monkey was
                happy ɪn hɪz new home, but baɪ and baɪ he heard that there was
                no longer a famɪne ɪn hɪz own lænd. Then he decided to go back.
                Before he started, Orang-outang made hɪm a present of a fɪddle
                and a bow and arrow, "Wɪth thɪs bow and arrow you cæn kɪl any
                animal," he said. "Wɪth thɪs fidl you cæn make anything dænce
                until you bɪd ɪt stop." Thænking hɪz uncle for the presents,
                Monkey set out on hɪz homeward journey. On the way he met
                Brother Wolf. "What newz, Brother Wolf?" æskt Monkey. When Wolf
                hæd told him the newz, Monkey æskt, "What hæv you bɪn doing
                to-day?" "Oh," said Wolf, "aɪ hæv bɪn following a deer all the
                morning, but aɪ hæv been unable to get near enough to kɪll him.
                Now aɪ æm faint wɪth hʌnger." "aɪ cæn help you," said Monkey.
                "aɪ hæv a mægɪc bow ænd arrow. Show me the dir, and aɪ wɪll
                brɪng hɪm down." When Wolf showed hɪm the dir, Monki fɪtted æn
                arrow to the bow and took eɪm. Hardly hæd the arrow left the bow
                when the dir fell dɛd. Monki ænd Wolf sæt down and hæd a good
                fist. æs Wolf eɪt, hi thought of the magɪc bow and arrow, and hi
                plænned to gɛt thɛm aweɪ frʌm Monki. "First aɪ wɪll æsk for
                thɛm,"hi sɛd to hɪmself. "ɪf Monki wɪll not gɪv thɛm to me, aɪ
                wɪll use force." Whɛn Wolf hæd fɪnɪshed eating, hi sɛd to Monki,
                "Pliz gɪv mi the bow and arrow." "aɪ wɪll not," sɛd Monki. "ðeɪ
                were a preznt from my dir uncle; waɪ should aɪ gɪv ðɛm to you?"
                "Very wɛll," sɛd Wolf. "aɪ am stronger ðæn you, and aɪ wɪll teɪk
                ðɛm baɪ force." Wʊlf waz just about tʊ snætch ðe bow and arrow
                from Monki when Jæckal came along. ðɛn Wʊlf thought of a new
                plæn.hi called out tə Jæckal, "hɛlp! hɛlp! Monki hæz stolən maɪ
                mægɪk bow ənd arrow." Jæckal came running to ðɛm. Wʊlf told hɪz
                saɪd əf ðə story, ænd Monki told hɪz. "aɪ kænnot bəlieve aɪðer
                əv you," sɛd Jækəl. "Lɛt əs leɪ ðə kwɛstion bəfore ðə kort. ðɛr,

                əɹound wəɹ ði oðeɹ ænɪməlz əf ðə jʌngl. monki told hɪz stoɹy
                fəɹst. stændɪŋ in fɹont of ðe thɹone, hi meɪd a low bow and sɛd,
                "ðe gɹeɪt fæmɪn, my lɔɹd, dɹove me out of my kountɹy, and aɪ hæd

                "hi does not tɛll ðe tɹuθ," kɹaɪd wʊlf. ðen jækal sɛd, "aɪ bɪliv
                ðæt ðe bow æn aɹɹow bɪlɑŋ to wʊlf; hi ən moŋki weɹe quaɹɹelɪŋ

                looked veɹy ɪnəsənt æn sɛd noθɪŋ. kɪŋ laɪən ɹose and asked,
                "what seɪ you? to whom do ðe bow æn aɹɹow bɪlɑŋ?" "to wʊlf,"
                theɪ all kɹaɪd. "stilɪŋ is a cɹime ðat must be punished," sɛd
                kɪŋ laɪən. "what ʃæll be done?" "lɛt moŋki be hanged," ðeɪ all
                kɹaɪd. moŋki stɪl hæd hɪz mæd͡ʒɪk fɪdl. holdɪŋ ɪt in hɪz hand, hi
                meɪd a deep baʊ and sɛd: "gɪv mi liv to play a tune on my fɪdl
                befoɹe aɪ hæŋ, o kɪŋ." now, ðe beasts all loved a meɹɹy tune,
                and knowɪŋ ðat monki was a mæsteɹ playeɹ ðeɪ called aʊt, "lɛt
                hɪm play." monki placed ðe fɪdl undeɹ hɪz chin, d͡ʒɹew ðe boʊ
                acɹoss ðe stɹɪŋs, and st͡ʃɹuk up "cɑkcɹoʊ." ðɪs waz a feɪvoɹɪt
                tune wɪθ ðe koɹt. at ðe fiɹst notes all nodded ðeiɹ hɛdz in taɪm
                to ðe muzɪk. as monki played ɑn, ðe ɛntiɹe koɹt bɪgæn to dæns.
                ɹound and ɹound ðeɪ went like a whiɹlwind. oveɹ and oveɹ, quikeɹ
                and quikeɹ sounded ðe tune of "cɑkcɹoʊ." fæsteɹ and fæsteɹ flew
                the danseɹz, untɪl one afteɹ anoðeɹ fell to ðe gɹound woɹn out.
                monki saw noθɪŋ of all ðɪz. wɪθ aɪz closed and hɪz head placed
                lovɪŋly against ðe fɪdl, hi played on and on, keepɪŋ taɪm wɪθ
                hɪz foot. wʊlf was ðe fiɹst one to cɹy out, "please stɑp, cousin
                monki. foɹ pɪty's seɪk, stɑp." but monki did not seem to heaɹ
                him. again and again sounded ðe mæd͡ʒɪk notes of "cɑkcɹoʊ." kɪŋ
                lion hæd gone ɹound and ɹound wɪθ hɪz young waɪf so many taɪmz
                that boθ weɹe ɹeady to d͡ʒɹop. at last, as hi passed monki, hi
                ɹoaɹed, "stɑp, eɪp! maɪ whole kɪŋdom ɪz youɹs ɪf you wɪll only
                stɑp playɪŋ." "aɪ do not want ɪt," sɛd monki. "meɪk wʊlf confess
                ðat hi tɹaɪd to steal my bow and aɹɹow. ðen aɪ wɪll stɑp
                playɪŋ." "aɪ confɛs! aɪ confɛs!" pænted wʊlf, who was ɹeady to
                fɑll to ðe gɹound. "gʊd," kɹaɪd kɪŋ lion, as ðe music stɑpt.
                "moŋki is innocent. let him have hɪz bow and aɹɹow." "punish
                wʊlf!" cɹied the ænɪməlz. so wʊlf was soundly beaten and dɹiven
                fɹom ðe koɹt. ðɛn monki went ɑff ɹɪˈd͡ʒɔɪsɪŋ, cɛɹiɪŋ wɪθ hɪm hɪz
                mæd͡ʒɪk gɪfs.
