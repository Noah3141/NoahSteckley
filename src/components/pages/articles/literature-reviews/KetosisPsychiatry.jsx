        <h3>A Meta Review</h3>
        <p className="">
          Research reviews published since 2021 were collected using Google
          Scholar. The prompt "Ketogenic Diets as a Psychiatric Intervention"
          garnered "about 1800" results. Of these, the first XX were parsed into
          the snippets below. All studies from the search are included (even if
          they are off-topic), in the order they appeared in the search. The
          parsing of these articles sometimes decontextualized statements which
          in the original context may have read as more or less problematic, but
          the effect of this on hypothesis-primacy should be washed out by
          comparatively invariable themes within the literature.

          results="A total of 32 experimental or observational studies were identified by initial search strategies, 14 of which met the criteria to be included in this analysis. Although specific diet formulations varied somewhat between studies, they all generally examined low-carbohydrate dietary intake with the goal of producing a ketotic state. The studies included in this review indicated the KD was beneficial in reducing symptoms associated with various psychiatric disorders."
          concl=" Data from the studies analyzed demonstrated a positive response in individuals who were able to remain on the diet, regardless of the disease state. "
          restrs="The small number of study participants is a limitation that prevents generalization."
          quote_1="§Bipolar: Additionally, study participants reported a decrease in depression, improved clarity of thought and speech, weight loss, and increased energy overall."
          quote_2="§Depression: The patient's scores decreased substantially from a baseline score of 17 (moderately severe) to 0 (no symptoms reported)"
          quote_3="§Schizophrenia: The patient reported diminished auditory and visual hallucinations approximately 8 days after initiation of the diet. She had no recurrences during the course of the 12-month intervention period. "

          concl="We conclude by calling for controlled clinical trials to confirm

          evidence that a ketogenic diet can improve both the metabolic and neural
          stability profiles. Specifically, a ketogenic diet improves mitochondrial
          metabolism, neurotransmitter function, oxidative stress/inflammation,
          while also increasing neural network stability and cognitive function."

          trial of 119 participants by McClernon et al. [23] reported participants
          assigned to a KD versus a low fat diet had significant decreases in body
          mass index (BMI) after six months, alongside mood improvements, and a

Studies found that KD treatment in animals has the potential to alleviate age-related cognitive decline. Over 80% of the 27 human studies reported a favourable effect of intervention, and none reported a detrimental effect of KD."
          restrs="While these findings suggest that KD may improve the functioning of certain cognitive domains, definitive conclusions were limited by studies with small sample sizes, the absence of controls and randomization, and the lack of objective measures of cognition."
