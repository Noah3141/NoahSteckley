                    Writing is not a purely rational process: it is guided by emotion, and the
                    knowledge of the writer is limited. By following the path of interest, areas
                    previously unclear become explored and clarified, whereupon behavioral
                    implications can then be extracted to update the personality, resolving the
                    “unconscious disturbance”—that is, the urge to sort something out. Mark Twain is
                    credited as having said “If you tell the truth, you don’t have to remember
                    anything.” Mark Twain is commenting here on the fact of the unconscious: a
                    lesson truly and honestly learned does not need intentional remembering, because
                    it restructures unconscious contents such that the novel lesson will become the
                    new automatic mode, the guess, and the first thing to mind, when the time comes.

                    Unconscious areas (referred to in the literature as “contents,” but the map
                    metaphor works better) which are close enough to consciousness to be given
                    semantic articulation are intimated as a question, the clarification of the
                    answer to which moves forward the development of consciousness. “How could this
                    happen to me?” It is precisely those questions which are steeped in
                    interest/fear which present the most motivationally relevant information for the
                    development of the individual personality (Neumann, 1949, p. 343).

                    A particular experience may present information well outside the realm of the
                    current personality. If this experience, or “novel stimulus exposure,”
                    demonstrates its vital relevance to the personality, it will be traumatic.
                    Trauma is simply a more extreme, and halted, version of a normal process. The
                    psychoanalysts noted this early on. A child, possessing a much smaller and less
                    differentiated behavioral and representational repertoire, is much more prone to
                    encounter with stimuli too “far from consciousness” to be brought close by their
                    meager exploratory and linguistic capabilities. It takes great religious courage
                    to brave an encounter with true evil. Religions have sought, in part, to
                    organize the proper abstractive representation of the world to motivate such
                    courage, thereby maintaining the psychological integrity of the individual in
                    the face of the most traumatic elements of collective life.

                    The normal process is described by Piaget, and aligns quite nicely with
                    psychoanalytic formulations. At the base is behaviorism. The behaviorists
                    studied very simple events, given to simple rats (a hungry rat is a much simpler
                    version of a normal rat). As far as I can tell, the proper interpretation of
                    behavioral studies is this: novel stimuli are indeterminate in their implication
                    for behavior, valuation, and representation (procedure, episode, and semantic
                    memory). The task is to sort this out. Stimuli which do not affect ongoing
                    goal-oriented behavior are categorized as irrelevant. As goal-oriented behavior
                    continues, the emergence of anomaly is marked by the irruption of emotion, which
                    is then “used to build” an adjustment to behavior, valuation, or representation
                    (also referred to as the hierarchy of values, or stimulus-valence map). If I
                    press a lever, and a pellet drops, I learn that the valence of lever-pressing is
                    as positive as the attainment of food, or perhaps more hippocampally speaking, I
                    learn that leaver pulling is a route that leads me to a place called “food.”
                    Insofar as I become hungry, I will press the lever predictably. The behaviorist
                    model, however, does not acknowledge the process by which certain conditioning
                    occurs as opposed to other.

                    If you burn your cookies, the first thing that happens is you are annoyed. You
                    failed to reach a goal, thus you know the map of behaviors and cognitions you
                    used to try to reach that goal is faulty. And so, the emotion translates into
                    “Why are my cookies burned? What did I do wrong?” The answer, as of yet, is
                    indeterminate. Operant conditioning is at a loss: will you cook less? Maybe.
                    What behavior, exactly, got coniditioned? The action of psychoanalytic
                    consciousness, that is, higher cortical structures, is then to determine which
                    behavior led off of the path to the goal, and to adjust accordingly. It is
                    during the generation of new moral behaviors that a habit-deterministic
                    worldview comes to an end, and consciousness is most alive (in existentialist
                    terms). This is met as a burst of insight (an emotional experience, let’s note),
                    the late-Jungian libido, as the new behavior-plan represents, roughly speaking,
                    a renewed hope in the potential achievement of the goal (and future avoidance of
                    burnt cookies, wasted resources and time, and recognition of personal idiocy
                    etc.) Insight is curative because emotions are intelligibly related to the
                    psyche as a whole—they are not random, and can signify real changes in the
                    personality.
                </p>
                <p>Imagine a website: “Top Ten Most Common Cookie Problems”</p>
                <p>
                    How is a site like this used? An annoyed (mildly traumatized) individual has
                    encountered an uncategorizable stimulus, and wishes to grow as a person, and so
                    seeks a viable interpretation to move the personality forward. “I didn’t know
                    that the world, or I, worked this way, but now I do, and I can act accordingly,
                    to better ends.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    A key tool in moving this process forward is the word (analogous to congruence,
                    and to the Jungian Self). As latent meaning is trapped within past experience,
                    it is articulated speech and the search for truth which untangles and heals.
                    Despite all ranges of emotion during this experience, I suspect that meaningful
                    engagement oversees the whole process of personality growth, such that an
                    empathically conjoined therapist, who is congruent about the felt state of the
                    conversation (referred to as “meta-statements” in one article), can feel the
                    felt-state of the client by mapping the emotions of client onto themselves, and
                    then guiding the pair towards the path of meaningful engagement (a true form of
                    “acceptance”) as the two adjust behavior according to their congruence. Rogers’
                    three principles are an abstract set up which, thus organized, will always
                    eventually lead to personality growth and healing. The client free-associates to
                    their complexes, the therapist maps himself onto the emotions and extracts
                    client-congruence through listening to the whole person, and thus the two
                    explore jointly the areas of dysfunctionality in the personality. Explicitly,
                    the Rogerian model does not contain techniques of integration. In fact,
                    previously I’ve thought that Rogerian therapy is obsessed with conscious-making,
                    and quite systematically leaves integration of newly discovered contents as an
                    implicit process. In a sense this is true, but I suspect that by the therapists
                    orienting the pair through “acceptance” (a wholly insufficient term), which is
                    to treat the client as a personality capable of growing through meaningful
                    courageous exploration, the pair not only free associates to complexes, but also
                    naturally works through the alteration of behavior and perception as a result.
                    All the therapist need know is how to be congruent so as to feel meaningful
                    engagement and keep the conversation on that track.

                <p>
                    In the case of truly traumatic experience, the valence of the involved stimuli
                    may be very intense, and the implications may be unimaginably complicated. In
                    their many “two-step models” and self-discrepancy theory, social psychologists
                    note again what psychoanalysts discovered: You can choose to not think about
                    something, despite it emotionally irrupting into, let’s say, “working memory.”
                    Because of the intensity and complexity of uncategorized stimuli, a person may
                    be unwilling or unable to explore the emergent unclarity passively, as is
                    usually done. The psychoanalysts claimed that the psyche is a self-regulating
                    system: if something pops into your head involuntarily, such as a flashback or
                    anxious intrusive thought, it is because what you are and what you know lacks
                    what's hidden in the unconsciously manifesting content (e.g. a plan to avoid the
                    danger). One can see how a child would have an even harder time encountering and
                    understanding (adjusting personality to) a powerful and frightening stimulus. We
                    do not quite know what it would mean to practice not thinking about
                    something—although we believe practice makes perfect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stimuli may have many different implications for many disparate sets of
                    motivated-behavior-plans, which can even be contradictory to one another. If
                    your partner leaves you, just before you were going to leave them, many
                    different emotions can come at once to mark the different relations of the
                    person to this event. Some things have been lost, others gained; some things
                    need replacing, others “extinguishing.” If the implications are never sorted
                    out, you might appear to be a “sensitized” person to the topic at large. Perhaps
                    a whole new behavioral set needs constructing. An encounter with a person whose
                    fundamental aim is to break someone, to hurt them as deeply as possible, forces
                    the individual exposed to this to reach their personality into the space of
                    religious philosophy, since the emergent information cannot be wished away, and
                    it is only by updating one’s behavior, valuation, and self-concept
                    isomorphically, honestly, and earnestly, that the experience can then be put to
                    rest—or perhaps, more accurately, put to use—once everything to be learned has
                    been brought forward into a new manifestation of the personality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The key turning point, as far as I can tell, in all trauma occurs when the
                    person can commit themselves on faith to the paradox that “Although it was novel
                    experience which so broke me, it is novel experience which will also cure me.”
                    This is, as far as I’m concerned, as much a Jungian statement as it is one
                    summarized behaviorist exposure therapy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, on the application of behaviorist principles to the topic of
                    “teaching.” It seems to me that punishment cannot create new behaviors. The
                    behavioral model proper even knows this: punishment lessens an already extant
                    behavior. The generation of new behavior cannot be forced by punishment: doing
                    so may well lead to maladjustment in a child. Punishing a maladaptive [read:
                    (contextually) “immoral”] behavior so as to reduce its occurrence is valid, and
                    helpful. Often children test out new behavior so as to get a read, from
                    knowledgeable adults, what the valence of that behavior is. Is this fun? Do you
                    like it when I do this? “No.” In many cases, saying ‘No’ and manifesting a
                    negative emotional reaction is enough to denote to the child that the quality of
                    the behavior is negative. The continuation of the bad behavior must be met with
                    a continuation of punishment, in gradual degree, to teach: the valence of the
                    behavior, the constancy thereof, and importance of others’ experience, the
                    surety of the knowledge structure into which the child is being inducted, a
                    sense that the morality of behavior is non-arbitrary, non-fluctuating, and
                    relative to something real. It quickly gets even more complicated however. A
                    misbehaving child in general may have a series of problems: not knowing proper
                    behavioral patterns as an alternative to misbehaving, being submerged in disdain
                    for adults in general (which only gets validated when punished, and is likely
                    justified disdain given the probable unconsciousness of the caregiver), being
                    submerged in resentment such that the child actually does not “have access” to
                    their own interest in doing good, helping others, and growing towards better
                    understanding. It’s not so unrare for an individual, child or adult, to become
                    so resentful of the world, others, and themself, that all urges towards growth,
                    truth, and good become bent into a will to hurt, cheat, lie, and repress.
                    Punishment does not on its own lead such a person into an “adaptive”
                    personality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A child needs to learn the ideal behavioral and valuative repertoire (culturally
                    mediated of course), most of which will involve the guided teaching of new
                    behaviors, partly moved forward by playful experimentation and reward of
                    success. I suppose, to try to pinpoint, the difference (that is, when punishment
                    is useful in teaching children versus when it is not) is: is the maladaptation a
                    result of a lack of knowledge or basic equilibrium, or is the maladaptation the
                    result of playful generation of poor behavior? Does the child know better?
                    Nobody taught pigeons to play ping pong by beating them when they didn’t do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As far as traumatic punishment goes, the “point” of the punishment needs to be
                    clear. This is done partly through discussion with the child, but also through
                    consistency in rules. The child is skeptical of your likely false ideological
                    explanations, and learns much more from your behavior. “They said such and such,
                    but I am doing the behavior again and they don’t care.” The surety and clarity
                    of the valence of behavior is key, along with the presence of knowledge and
                    skill allowing the manifestation of positively-valenced behavior. It is unclear,
                    unjust, random punishment which warps a child. Unthinking and unconscious
                    parents will embody the “spirit” of their parents, despite how it struck them in
                    childhood, and thus propagate maladaptive personality (behaviors, valuations,
                    and representational schema) down generations. Or, they may overcorrect, an
                    “enantiodromia,” whereby knowledge only of the problem, but not of a solution,
                    results in unconscious adoption of a position felt to be as different as
                    possible from the known problem-position. This form of psychological reactance
                    is a key part of Jung’s work. The only solution is to completely think it
                    through.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One parent brutally punished their child for speaking at the dinner table
                    (because the parent was resentful about 50 repressed problems in the household
                    and wished to cower in silence), and so the child grows up to believe “One
                    simply mustn’t ever speak at the dinner table.” This child may grow up to
                    either: 1) treat their child the same (unreflectingly holding steady the
                    valuation given to them), or 2) allow their children to run rampant at the
                    dinner table, because of inarticulate (“unconscious”) fear that they will do to
                    their children what their parents did to them; willful negligence, colored by
                    uncomfort, in clarifying an alternative; or spiteful revenge against their
                    parent (present in the flesh or not) by turning their children into the opposite
                    of what they had been raised to be. In each case, a dishonestly ignored emotion
                    marks the problem (a Freudian note). By looking into the emotion, the question
                    “How should one act at the dinner table?” must be generated, and confronted, and
                    explored, a process which will bring up their parental interactions. These
                    reactions may be categorized, respectively, as tyrannically holding on to an
                    interpretation (inherited, or counterreacted), despite its effects, and
                    nihilistically abstaining from any clear interpretation of proper behavior
                    whatsoever. The solution to both is the honest exploration of moral behavior as
                    a result of refusing to repress one’s own emotional reactions. Honesty,
                    integrity, and attention.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is not intense punishment that produces maladaptivity in children: it is the
                    unconsciousness of the parent—unconsidered rules which do not match the world,
                    do not match society, or are not applied consistently enough so as to allow the
                    child to develop a clear interpretation of what behavior must be extinguished.
                    All of this is solved by speaking: speak to your partner, speak to the child,
                    speak to your peers, reach an integrated consensus. Know what is good, know what
                    is bad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rules applied upon a child must be adapted to—give space to—the reality of
                    the child as a biological entity. This is to say, behaviors must satisfy the
                    needs of the organism. Punishing a behavior which attempts to do this can only
                    be helpful when an alternative mode of goal attainment is brought into the
                    picture.
