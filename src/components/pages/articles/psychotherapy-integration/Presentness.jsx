                        I'm under no impression that this is the right answer. I don't even know
                        that it is much of a good answer. But the truth is in the process of
                        attempting to figure out what is true. Here are some of the ideas that came
                        to mind, for me, on the topic: Mindfulness and presentness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What does it actually mean to be present? Well, you might say it is allowing
                        your sensory scope to match with your attentional, emotional scope. But
                        there’s more to it than that, which is that you're not precisely in control
                        of whether those match. You’re not generally <i>causing</i> them to be out
                        of alignment, nor can we precisely train you to "allow" yourself be present.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some proprietors of the concept of presence can miss the distinction between
                        the benefits of being present, and the benefits of being <i>able</i> to be
                        present. These kinds of mistakes in construct discrimination are ubiquitous
                        in psychology, with all disciplines falling prey to them in their own ways.
                        They seek the benefits of being able to be present, by fostering{" "}
                        <i>being</i> present. Now, a proper integrative approach does not paint one
                        set of theorists as causelessly deluded. So what's going on here? I think
                        what they're apprehending is that encouraging presentness can lead to the
                        development of being <i>able</i> to be present, under certain circumstances,
                        with the right context. That context is a Gestalt-y one: if something comes
                        to mind from the past, that is your presentness. The shortcoming only lies
                        with those that insist that presentness is restricted to a here-and-now form
                        of sensory input. This is <i>literally</i> shortsighted. By that I mean,
                        human beings are highly skilled at seeing around corners, with their
                        imagination, with their projection of themselves into the future, with their
                        complex and nested hierarchy of goals, termed by the behaviorists
                        "higher-order associations." Because of this ability, an object not
                        physically present can make itself more psychologically relevant than the
                        room one sits in. And of course, this is good, since this very ability is
                        what has allowed human being to apprehend complex problems and invent their
                        solutions, before they wipe us out. Those who see the ability to choose{" "}
                        <i>localized</i> presentness apart from this form of distractedness are
                        severely missing the point, which is that being <i>able</i> to be present
                        comes as a product of 'mental health', but that does not mean that engaging
                        in here-and-now, sensory input presentness does anything positive whatsoever
                        for long-term mental health.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So we've established that presentness of the sort that includes the ability
                        to focus <i>in</i> on those distractions which take us from the
                        "here-and-now" is the form of presentness that its supporters are
                        apprehending as genuinely useful. Why is this helpful? The answer lies in
                        what exactly causes the disconnect in the first place, between an intention
                        to attend to the here-and-now, and what actually siezes attention.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What causes this disconnect? The psychoanalysts termed them "complexes"
                        (Freud tried to implore the community to call these very same things
                        "resistences," but this had too many assumptions cooked into it), while
                        other theorists have interacted with the construct in a more disseminated or
                        unspecified manner. Cognitive-Behavioral theorists for instance think of
                        complexes solely in terms of the practical outputs of the complex, the
                        maladaptive symptoms: the automatic thoughts, the behavioral avoidances, the
                        cognitive distortions etc. Indeed, there is some cause to consider this the
                        realer of the two models, as Jungians tended towards a dishonest form of
                        over-personification and localization of the construct, which had its point,
                        doubtless, but definitely overstayed its welcome, receiving never the
                        sufficient degree of insightful contextualization or delimitation. Rogerian
                        theory, as far as I've seen, never much bothered to outline any contents of
                        the mind (rather, intently declined to concern itself with this), apart from
                        top level attitudes, but is built essentially around pragmatic attitudinal
                        entry points for the process which acts upon the underlying constructs. This
                        is why Rogerian theory is such a good fallback, and a staple for when one's
                        mental model of a psyche reaches the limits of available constructs.

                    <p>
                        What do these disconnects look like? To keep the discussion to the every
                        day, one person might be unable to tolerate friendly disagreement, another
                        might be overly forward, another incapable of crying without it making them
                        unbearably angry, another unable to hold a conversation out of fear of
                        sudden disagreement, dispute, and abandonment. One person is terrified that
                        they left the stove on, another can't hardly imagine driving their child to
                        school, unable to get the fantasy of a car crash out of their mind. It gets
                        worse from there, and horror movies make their point.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In these cases one is not able to voluntarily place their attention on the
                        immediate sensory (or even perhaps localized emotional) experience and
                        instead, something else makes itself most relevant. A poor interpretation of
                        being present involves considering these to be distractions that are to
                        practice being avoided. A more accurate perspective explains that these
                        interruptions of the ability to be present our sign posts of where one’s
                        true attention ought to lie. And perhaps, if that object is not present
                        currently, you should not be present, but rather be with it. Instead of
                        presentness denoting a form of self-blinding physicality into the place one
                        currently sits (which, by the way, is the product of previous
                        presence-impresence!), presentness might connect the distraction, with the
                        place you <i>ought</i> to <i>put yourself.</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You might think: "Well, God, why the hell do I have to deal with that? It's
                        stupid. I'm just going to be in the here-and-now." And this is
                        understandable, given that any person's unique life-process is bound to
                        direct them in the course of tragedy towards isolating realms, problems, for
                        which no one else knows the solution. But there's a real problem with this,
                        apart from all that can be said about it leaving the problem at hand. See,
                        we're generally faced with the conundrum, when considering a problem, of
                        whether or not we can't just tolerate leaving it unsolved! But my sense is
                        that when someone is beset by this form of impresence, "poor mental health",
                        you've only got the choice between two poisons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can choose to leave the problem there, and suffer it indefinitely, and
                        that is a real choice, but I think the problem is that it leaves you with
                        what is essentially meaningless suffering. "I simply get to be the one who
                        can't focus on a conversation because I'm terrified of germs. That's just
                        where I'm at." This choice offers at the best of times, freedom, and, at the
                        worst, suicide. Without a way out, life itself becomes a corrupt game, and
                        God to blame. This is a route to making the very problem worse, and
                        sometimes, to atrocity. We have, in our history, many times seen the
                        consequences of a society filled with just too many people gripped by the
                        conviction that life deserves to be gotten back at.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So what is the alternative? What's the other poison? Well, the other option
                        is something like "taking up one's cross with Him and getting a move on," or
                        put alternatively, "accepting the challenge to face the dragon lurking
                        outside of the city." The negatives are not light. Isolation from your
                        social surround both in the immediate sense, which can mean anything from
                        spending time not working on homework, to focusing on things no one wants to
                        admit to the existence of, and isolation in a longer-term sense, through the
                        exposure of oneself to experiences that other people lack, and which, many
                        may be unable to connect with. These are in many ways temporary and
                        impractically melodramatic problems, but the problem one can't dismiss so
                        easily is the genuine difficulty of facing emergent trouble.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But there's at least one benefit, that might overpower it all, which is that
                        the moment you accept the adventure—which is predicated on the adoption of a
                        kind of faith, a belief that things can change, that you can grow, that
                        problems can be solved, that you can learn anything you truly need to learn
                        if you're willing to learn it—the moment you accept the adventure, you
                        immediately regain "connection with God," a unity to your perspectives, a
                        superordinate order to your experience (despite the supordinate
                        unpleasantness), and most of all the suffering becomes meaningful, and
                        comprehensible within the unfolding structure of your self, your identity,
                        and your life narrative.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That's all beyond the mere fact of eventually getting past the problem, on
                        with your life, and free from distraction and impresence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this way, presentness isn’t just in alignment with your sensory
                        experience, which might be providing to you an otherwise arbitrary set of
                        sensory stimuli, but rather an alignment of sensory experience, attentional
                        hierarchy, and one’s very behavior. That is, if your attention when trying
                        to be present is forced away from what is right in front of you, that means
                        you have to put yourself somewhere else. And then in that somewhere else,
                        your sensory presence, attentional presence, emotional presence, bodily
                        presence can all align, in light of the goal of "sorting yourself out," into
                        a sense of trepidation, yet integrity, and meaning—a fear that although
                        frightened says "I have looked in the face of Death, and not gone running. I
                        am what I am, and I will have my life while I have it."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This individualized experience leads not only to the resolution of the
                        factors which distract from moment to moment, presentness, but the
                        acquisition of <i>experience in transformation</i>, "faith in the
                        transcendent" (religious), understanding of the "collective unconscious"
                        (Jungians), "increasingly existential living" (Rogers, A Way of Being, p.
                        188)—experience, which adds to an individual's sense of generalized ability
                        to confront the unknown and extract worthy being from it.

                    <p>
                        Presentness in a moment, like patience, is the product of previous action,
                        not current action. It is developed by the adventure of squaring away all
                        things in one's life, and moving forward in an integrated manner towards
                        well-formulated, valued goals, starting from what is immediately relevant{" "}
                        <i>to you</i>, and acting in the world, until clarity makes itself known.
