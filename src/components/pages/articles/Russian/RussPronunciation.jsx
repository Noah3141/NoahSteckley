              Once upon a taɪm there was a great famine ɪn the land, and Monkey
              could faɪnd no food. There were no bulbs, no beans, no ɪnsects,
              nor anything else to eat. At last Monkey said to hɪmself, "Waɪ
              should aɪ perish here with hunger? Maɪ uncle Orang-outang haz
              enough and to spare; aɪ shall go to hɪm, and he wɪll gɪve me food
              and shelter." So he set out and soon came to the place where
              Orang-outang lɪved. For a long taɪm Monkey was happy ɪn hɪz new
              home, but baɪ and baɪ he heard that there was no longer a famɪne
              ɪn hɪz own lænd. Then he decided to go back. Before he started,
              Orang-outang made hɪm a present of a fɪddle and a bow and arrow,
              "Wɪth thɪs bow and arrow you cæn kɪl any animal," he said. "Wɪth
              thɪs fidl you cæn make anything dænce until you bɪd ɪt stop."
              Thænking hɪz uncle for the presents, Monkey set out on hɪz
              homeward journey. On the way he met Brother Wolf. "What newz,
              Brother Wolf?" asked Monkey. When Wolf hæd told him the newz,
              Monkey æsked, "What hæv you been doing to-day?" "Oh," said Wolf,
              "aɪ hæv been following a deer all the morning, but aɪ have been
              unable to get near enough to kɪll him. Now aɪ am faint wɪth
              hunger." "aɪ cæn help you," said Monkey. "aɪ hæv a magɪc bow ænd
              arrow. Show me the deer, and aɪ wɪll brɪng hɪm down." When Wolf
              showed hɪm the deer, Monkey fɪtted an arrow to the bow and took
              aim. Hardly hæd the arrow left the bow when the deer fell dɛd.
              Monkey and Wolf sæt down and hæd a good feast. As Wolf ate, he
              thought of the magɪc bow and arrow, and he plænned to gɛt thɛm
              away from Monkey. "First aɪ wɪll æsk for thɛm," he sɛd to himself.
              "ɪf Monkey wɪll not gɪv thɛm to me, aɪ wɪll use force." Whɛn Wolf
              hæd finished eating, he sɛd to Monkey, "Pleaze gɪv me the bow and
              arrow." "aɪ wɪll not," sɛd Monkey. "ðey were a preznt from my dear
              uncle; waɪ should aɪ gɪv ðɛm to you?" "Very wɛll," sɛd Wolf. "aɪ
              am stronger ðæn you, and aɪ wɪll take thɛm baɪ force." Wʊlf waz
              just about to snætch the bow and arrow from Monkey when Jæckal
              came along. Thɛn Wʊlf thought of a new plan. He called out to
              Jackal, "hɛlp! hɛlp! Monkey has stolen my magic bow and arrow."
              Jæckal came running to thɛm. Wʊlf told hɪz saɪd of the story, and
              Monkey told hɪz. "aɪ cænnot believe eiðer of you," said Jæckal.
              "Lɛt us lay the quɛstion before the court. ðere, Lion, Tiger, and
              the other ænimalz wɪll hear you both; perhaps ðeɪ wɪll be able to
              dɪsaɪd to whom the mægic bow and arrow belong. but to keep you two
              from quarreling, aɪ hæd better teɪk care of ðe bow and arrow."
              monkey geɪv thɛm to jackal, and all three started ɑff to court.
              when ðeɪ arrived, ðere sæt lion on ve throne. seated around were
              ðe oðer ænimalz of ðe jungle. monkey told hɪz story first. stændɪŋ
              in front of ðe throne, he meɪd a low bow and sɛd, "ðe greɪt fæmɪn,
              my lord, drove me out of my country, and aɪ hæd to teɪk refuge wɪθ
              maɪ uncle. whɛn aɪ started bæck home, he geɪve me ðɪs bow and
              arrow. faɪndɪŋ wʊlf almost starvɪŋ, aɪ shot a deer for him.
              instead of beɪŋ greɪtful for ðe food, he traɪd to rɑb me of ðe bow
              and arrow. aɪ æm here to ask ðæt you restore ðɛm to me." "he does
              not tɛll ðe truθ," craɪd wʊlf. ven jækal sɛd, "aɪ believe ðæt ðe
              bow and arrow belong to wʊlf; he ænd monkey were quarrelɪŋ abaʊt
              thɛm whɛn aɪ came along. ðeɪ agreed to leave the question to you,
              kɪŋ lion. aɪ know you wɪll see that justice is done." wʊlf looked
              very innocent and sɛd nothɪŋ. kɪŋ lion rose and asked, "what seɪ
              you? to whom do the bow and arrow bɪlɑŋ?" "to wʊlf," theɪ all
              cried. "stealɪŋ is a crime that must be punished," sɛd kɪŋ lion.
              "what ʃæll be done?" "lɛt monkey be hanged," ðeɪ all cried. monkey
              still hæd hɪz mæd͡ʒɪk fiddle. holdɪŋ it in hɪz hand, he made a deep
              baʊ and sɛd: "gɪv me leave to play a tune on my fiddle before aɪ
              hæŋ, o kɪŋ." now, the beasts all loved a merry tune, and knowɪŋ
              that monkey was a master player ðeɪ called aʊt, "lɛt hɪm play."
              monkey placed the fiddle under hɪz chin, d͡ʒrew the boʊ across the
              strɪŋs, and st͡ʃɹuck up "cɑckcroʊ." thɪz waz a feɪvorite tune wɪth
              the court. at the first notes all nodded their hɛdz in taɪm to the
              muzɪk. as monkey played ɑn, the ɛntire court begæn to dænce. round
              and round ðeɪ went like a whirlwind. over and over, quicker and
              quicker sounded the tune of "cɑckcroʊ." faster and faster flew the
              dancers, untɪl one after another fell to the ground worn out.
              monkey saw nothɪŋ of all thɪz. wɪth aɪz closed and hɪz head placed
              lovɪŋly against the fiddle, he played on and on, keepɪŋ taɪm wɪth
              hɪz foot. wʊlf was the first one to cry out, "please stɑp, cousin
              monkey. for pɪty's seɪk, stɑp." but monkey did not seem to hear
              him. again and again sounded the mæd͡ʒɪk notes of "cɑckcroʊ." kɪŋ
              lion hæd gone round and round wɪth hɪz young waɪf so many taɪms
              that both were ready to d͡ʒrop. at last, as he passed monkey, he
              roared, "stɑp, eɪp! maɪ whole kɪŋdom ɪz yours ɪf you wɪll only
              stɑp playɪŋ." "aɪ do not want ɪt," sɛd monkey. "meɪk wʊlf confess
              that he traɪd to steal my bow and arrow. then aɪ wɪll stɑp
              playɪŋ." "aɪ confess! i confess!" pænted wʊlf, who was ready to
              fall to the ground. "good," cried kɪŋ lion, as the music stɑpped.
              "monkey is innocent. let him have hɪz bow and arrow." "punish
              wʊlf!" cried the ænimalz. so wʊlf was soundly beaten and driven
              from the court. ðɛn monkey went ɑff rejoɪsɪŋ, carryɪŋ wɪth him hɪz
              magic gɪfts.
