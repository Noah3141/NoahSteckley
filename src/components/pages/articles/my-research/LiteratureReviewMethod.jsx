            <h5>"A review is the highest form of evidence"</h5>

            <p>
                Upon attempting some systematic reviews myself, I realized that the tools to make
                that process rigorous, reasonable, accurate, and comprehensive were not at my
                disposal. This was made worse by the number of reviews I <i>found</i> that were done
                haphazardly, missing research, out of date, or proposing models which made no
                interdisciplinary attempts at all. Something is not right here.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result, writing these review articles has been postponed until I have invented
                the technology to make comprehensive, detailed, systematic, unbiased reviews much
                easier. I have a number of plans, one of which is to create a scaffolded, directed,
                scientific process mindmap tool, that will provide a visualized aid scientific
                thinking, topic analysis, and the conduction of reviews. This product will require
                sponsorship before development can begin.
